        <dt><b>Dragon</b></dt>
        <!-- definition:-->
        <dd>A dragon is a large magical legendary creature that appears in the folklore of many 
            cultures worldwide. Beliefs about dragons vary considerably through regions, 
            but dragons in western cultures since the High Middle Ages have often been 
            depicted as winged, horned, and capable of breathing fire.

        <dt><b>Phoenix</b></dt>
        <dd>The phoenix is an immortal bird that cyclically regenerates or is otherwise born again.
            While it's part of Greek mythology, it has analogs in many cultures such as Egyptian
            and Persian. Associated with the sun, a phoenix obtains new life by rising from
            the ashes of its predecessor.

        <dt><b>Vampire</b></dt>
        <dd>A vampire is a mythical creature that subsists by feeding on the vital essence
            (generally in the form of blood) of the living. In European folklore,
            vampires are undead creatures that often visited loved ones and caused
            mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods which they inhabited while they were alive.

        <dt><b>Werewolf</b></dt>
        <dd>In folklore, a werewolf, or occasionally lycanthrope is an individual who 
            can shape-shift into a wolf (or, especially in modern film, a therianthropic
            hybrid wolf-like creature), either purposely or after being placed under a curse
            or affliction (often a bite or the occasional scratch from another werewolf),
            with the transformations occurring on the night of a full moon.
